## Interactive 3D places

Every seed place has a procedural three.js model: zero imported meshes, generated at runtime, with hotspots that match the editorial feature list.

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If port 3000 is taken, Next.js will pick the next free port (this project often lands on **3001**).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| App | Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 |
| 3D | three.js, procedural geometry, no GLBs |
| UI | Tailwind CSS 4, Base UI, lucide icons |
| Maps | Google Maps via `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` |
| Tests | Vitest on the shipped layout/anchor helpers |

Each 3D page keeps WebGL out of the server render (`next/dynamic`, `ssr: false`). Camera anchors, palettes and feature order live in pure helpers so they can be tested without a canvas.
